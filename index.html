                    I love League of Legends and play competitively. I also make custom mods for League of Legends! Because of that, I've been working with code for a while now. I play LoL tournaments and work on improving all the time.

                    I started playing League of Legends in 2014, and started playing ranked solo queue in 2015. Then, I got into modding in 2016. I've improved my rank every season, and have no plans to stop. I am very passionate about the game, the mods, the competition, and eSports.

                    In League, I can play a variety of champions. My first main was Riven and I have reached over 900 000 mastery on her. However, I transitioned to mid lane in 2018, and haven't played Riven as much since then. My champions for mid lane are: Yasuo, Cassiopeia, Xerath, Vel'Koz, Akali, Twisted Fate, Zed, Rumble, Katarina, Azir, Sylas, Irelia, and quite a bit more.

                    There are other games than League of Legends. I play a variety of games on the side: CS:GO, Hearts of Iron IV, Minecraft, Spore, Command & Conquer: Red Alert. Coding is a game of its own as well!
